# Lens Distortion Correction in the Current Source

## Applied method

The current implementation does not resample the image into a rectified image.
Cedar or SEP first detects star centroids in each original RAW tile, and only
those coordinates are undistorted in the full-sensor coordinate system. This
avoids changing stellar intensity or PSF through image interpolation.

The processing sequence is:

1. Detect star centroids `(y, x)` in the original tile.
2. Add the tile origin to obtain full-frame coordinates.
3. Load an active calibration profile matching the camera, lens, RAW/crop
   geometry, and pixel pitch.
4. Numerically invert the Brown–Conrady model with eight fixed-point iterations.
5. Convert the corrected points back to tile-local coordinates and pass them to
   the tetra3 solver.

The core implementation is in `python/PiFinder/mf_wide_distortion.py`; it is
called from `python/PiFinder/solver.py`, and its position in the solve pipeline
is defined in `python/PiFinder/mf_wide_solver.py`.

## Formula

For a frame of size `(H, W)`, the optical centre and normalization scale are:

```text
cy = (H - 1) / 2
cx = (W - 1) / 2
s  = sqrt((H/2)^2 + (W/2)^2)     # centre-to-corner radius
yd = (Yd - cy) / s
xd = (Xd - cx) / s
```

Let `(xu, yu)` be the undistorted normalized coordinates and
`r² = xu² + yu²`. The forward Brown–Conrady model is:

```text
radial = 1 + k1*r² + k2*r⁴ + k3*r⁶

x_model = xu*radial + 2*p1*xu*yu + p2*(r² + 2*xu²)
y_model = yu*radial + p1*(r² + 2*yu²) + 2*p2*xu*yu
```

Because the input `(xd, yd)` is already distorted, the implementation uses the
following fixed-point update for eight iterations instead of a closed-form
inverse:

```text
xu <- xu + (xd - x_model)
yu <- yu + (yd - y_model)
```

It starts with `xu = xd` and `yu = yd`, then converts the result back to pixels:

```text
Yu = yu*s + cy
Xu = xu*s + cx
```

`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are radial coefficients; `p1` and `p2` are tangential
coefficients. This project normalizes coordinates so that the frame-corner
radius is one; it does not use a focal-length-based camera matrix `K` here.

## Manual TV-distortion seed

When a provisional profile is created from a lens data sheet, the first-order
radial coefficient is scaled to the physical sensor footprint:

```text
r_sensor = sqrt((crop_width*pitch/2)^2 + (crop_height*pitch/2)^2)
k1_initial = sign * abs(TV_percent)/100 * (r_sensor/r_reference)^2
```

The sign is `-1` for barrel distortion and `+1` for pincushion distortion.
Unknown `k2`, `k3`, `p1`, and `p2` values are set to zero. This is a provisional
seed, not a final measured calibration.

## Current stored profile and runtime state

`PiFinder_data/config.json` selects an on-sky profile for
`imx462_color + 6mm`:

```text
model = brown_conrady
k1 = -0.04389242740018018
k2 = k3 = p1 = p2 = 0
evidence = 6 frames, 2 sky directions, 138 matched stars
central/mid/edge samples = 26/75/37
median RMSE = 97.0 arcsec -> 56.09 arcsec (42.18% improvement)
```

However, `wide_solver_enabled` is currently `false` in the same configuration.
The profile is stored and selected, but the wide-tile solver and its centroid
correction are inactive at runtime. The correction is used only when this flag
is enabled and the tile-solver eligibility conditions are met.

The current runtime source also does not contain the coefficient-fitting
algorithm itself. It implements validation and persistence of externally
produced/on-sky coefficients, plus the correction algorithm that consumes them.

## Safety behavior

- Correction is skipped unless the model is `brown_conrady` and all
  coefficients are finite numbers.
- Empty centroid lists and invalid frame dimensions preserve the input.
- If an iteration produces NaN or infinity, all original coordinates are
  returned unchanged.
- A profile is not loaded when its fingerprint does not match the camera,
  lens, RAW/crop geometry, and pixel pitch.
