- [ ] Home state, Park state, and raw `:GU#` status are displayed separately
- [ ] Manual Backlash reads/writes `Backlash.Backlash RA/DEC` without mount motion
- [ ] Auto Backlash requires a fresh plate-solved `PointingCoordinateService.solved` coordinate and does not check IMU Compass/MAG calibration
- [ ] Auto Backlash syncs mount coordinates to solved RA/Dec and disables tracking before the loop

- [ ] Auto Backlash waits for stable INDI idle and OnStep `:GU#` `N` (`No goto`) before recording post-GoTo mount/solved samples
- [ ] Auto Backlash turns tracking Off again after every GoTo leg
- [ ] Alt/Az mounts move `AZ`/`ALT`, while EQ mounts move `RA`/`DEC`, one axis at a time with fixed GoTo start/offset points
- [ ] Auto Backlash records each GoTo leg's start mount coordinates, end mount coordinates, and start/end PiFinder solved coordinates
- [ ] Legs where mount delta and solved-coordinate delta differ by 1 degree or more are excluded, and the displayed estimate uses the middle 40% mean after trimming the lowest/highest 30%
- [ ] Auto Backlash displays separate recommendations by actual movement direction, such as `AZ+/-`, `ALT+/-` in Alt/Az mode or `RA+/-`, `DEC+/-` in EQ mode
- [ ] Auto Backlash only displays the calculated value and does not change input fields or apply anything before `Save Backlash`

- [ ] Read current Backlash RA/DEC
- [ ] Save Backlash RA/DEC manually from the UI and confirm the driver value changes
- [ ] Auto Backlash requires a fresh plate-solved coordinate and does not require Compass/NDOF or MAG calibration
- [ ] Auto Backlash disables tracking for the motion test and restores the
      original tracking state only after successful completion
- [ ] Auto Backlash does not reset, apply, or restore Backlash RA/DEC; it only
      displays calculated candidate values for the user to review
- [ ] If the solved GoTo loop cannot capture reliable mount/solved motion records,
      Auto Backlash fails without applying a value
- [ ] PiFinder UI while INDI server is stopped
- [ ] PiFinder while OnStep device is offline

- battery/sound/power/latch are not applied

Not applied:

- BQ25895 battery telemetry
- BQ25895 fast-charge configuration writes
- sound/earcon buzzer subsystem
- GPIO15 hardware power button
- GPIO14 gpio-poweroff latch

      `test_sep_fullframe_solve.py`

## 18. Auto Exposure — Star-Count Controller

Priority: P1

Main changes: star-count servo selected via Camera Exp "Star"
(`camera_exp=auto_star`), solve-success hold (ADR m0022), anchor clamps.
ADR m0020/m0021/m0022.

Key files: `python/PiFinder/auto_exposure_starcount.py`, `auto_exposure.py`,
`camera_interface.py`

Review / test items:

- [ ] Star mode select/deselect without regressing the stock AE modes
- [ ] `test_auto_exposure_starcount.py`

## 19. SQM Radiometer Stack + Mono Colour Guard

Priority: P1

Main changes:

- Upstream SQM stack ported (#532/#542/#543/#544): radiometer-first
  publishing, raw-green photometry, Gaia colour correction, wizard, sweeps
- Sweep exposure settling (#561) and the sky-colour zero point (#560)
  ported **with the mono guard** — without it the measured-mono imx462
  drifts ~+0.74 mag (`mf_report/mf_mono_sqm_colour_guard_20260805_*.md`)

Key files: `python/PiFinder/sqm/*`, `python/PiFinder/ui/sqm*.py`

Review points:

- [ ] imx462 SQM keeps the constant zero point (no colour fields)
- [ ] Open items: bias-238 night re-verification + one SQM wizard run

Test items: `test_sqm.py`, `test_radiometer.py`, `test_radiometric_fit.py`,
`test_sweep_frame_record.py`

## 20. LiveCam RAW Preview / Live Stack / Web Camera Controls

Priority: P1

Main changes:

- RAW preview + rolling stack, SEP overlay, `/api/camera/controls`
  exposure/gain, 16-bit TIFF download
- Live view always streams JPEG; the format setting governs downloads only
  (UI label "Download Format")
- Downloads are grayscale (mono sensor — debayer chroma is an artifact)

Key files: `python/PiFinder/raw_live_stack.py`, `livecam_config.py`,
`api_extensions.py`, `python/views/livecam.html`

Review / test items:

- [ ] Live refresh rate holds with the PNG setting (JPEG stream)
- [ ] Downloads deliver the chosen format verbatim (incl. webp)
- [ ] `test_raw_live_stack.py`, `test_api_camera_controls.py`

## 21. Web Catalogs / Unified Search / Observing Lists

Priority: P1

Main changes: on-device web catalog pages (routes/filters/push,
designation-first search ranking); WDS lazy-load designed (not built);
Stellarium/CSV import (upstream, applied)

Key files: `python/PiFinder/web_catalogs.py`, `python/views/catalogs*.html`

Review / test items:

- [ ] Unified-search ordering (designation first) and push-to
- [ ] Manual web-UI pass

## 22. Joystick / Gamepad Input

Priority: P2

Main changes: direct evdev reading (`joystick_input.py`), Settings >
Advanced > Joystick binding UI, mount jog wiring. `python3-evdev` installed
by the setup script.

Review / test items:

- [ ] Button capture/bind/Clear All, `test_joystick_input.py`

## 23. Software Update Channel — Fork Releases / m-Version

Priority: P1

Main changes:

- Release check and NixOS migration gate URLs point at
  `hjoungjoo/MF_PiFinder`'s release branch (never brickbots — pinned by
  tests)
- `version.txt` uses the m-prefix scheme (`m2.6.0`); `_semver_tuple()`
  strips it for comparison
- An unresolvable release ("Unknown") renders an info line instead of
  "Update Now"

Key files: `python/PiFinder/ui/software.py`, `version.txt`

Review / test items:

- [ ] After cutting a release branch: version compare / Update Now /
      `pifinder_update.sh` flow
- [ ] `test_software.py` (4 m-version + Unknown branch + 2 URL pins)

## 24. Display — SSD1333 Auto-Detection + Four-Axis Brightness

Priority: P2 (P1 once the SSD1333 panel is adopted)

Main changes:

- MF auto-detection: BQ25895 (0x6A) ACK → ssd1333, fallback ssd1351
  (`hardware_detect.py`)
- Upstream #568+#570 four-axis brightness, partial port (driver + tests +
  model docs; bench harnesses/journals excluded — see the MF note in
  `docs/ax/display/ssd1333-response.md`)
- Pi5 SPI helper (`display_spi`), `bus_speed_hz` signatures, MF `rotate=0`
  preserved

Review points:

- [ ] **A non-rev4 board with an SSD1333 needs `--display ssd1333`**
      (auto-detection keys on the rev4 marker)
- [ ] Title-bar dimmest shade stays lit across the brightness range
      (no real-panel measurement yet)

Test items: `test_ssd1333_brightness.py` (17),
`test_hardware_detect_display.py` (4)

## 25. Install Script / Migrations

Priority: P0

Main changes:

- `pifinder_setup.sh` = the fork installer (clones main); the upstream
  original is preserved as `pifinder_setup.sh.bak`
- SD-wear reduction (tmpfs /tmp, indiserver logrotate, journald cap),
  python3-evdev install, console autologin (B2)
- MF migrations: `mf_apsta_wifi`, `mf_wifi_settings`, `mf_removeipc`
  (marker-file gated — not version-string gated)

Review / test items:

- [ ] Fresh-OS `pifinder_setup.sh` completes as a normal user
- [ ] On upstream merges this file conflicts → reconcile against `.bak`
- [ ] `test_wifi_apsta_static.py` (reads the setup script by path)

## Minimum Regression Commands

The full suite finishes in under a minute (1,114 tests / ~55 s on the Pi4
venv as of 2026-08-05), so run it whole instead of curating file lists:

```bash
cd python/ && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest -m "smoke or unit" -q
nox -s lint && nox -s format
```

Note: without the venv the system Python lacks selenium and collection
aborts on `tests/website` — check the venv first.
