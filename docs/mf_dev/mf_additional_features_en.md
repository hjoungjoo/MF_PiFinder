# MF PiFinder Additional Features

[English](mf_additional_features_en.md) | [한국어](mf_additional_features_ko.md)

This page is the user-facing index for features that MF PiFinder adds or
substantially extends beyond the original PiFinder project. Refer to each
linked document for design details, limitations, and validation status.

## Before using an extension

- Test mount control, alignment, and camera-calibration features indoors
  before connecting them to an observing setup.
- INDI mount control is optional and disabled by default.
- Treat experimental features separately from stable observing workflows and
  read their constraints before field use.
