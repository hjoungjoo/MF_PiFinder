# Recover a wedged Wi-Fi chip (brcmfmac) without a reboot.
#
# The CYW43455 shares one 2.4 GHz radio between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. High
# duty-cycle BT phases (pairing, boot-time reconnect storms) can wedge the
# firmware's STA state machine: the link drops and no supplicant retry can
# bring it back (docs/mf_dev/mf_change_history_ko.md, 2026-08-05 incident).
# Service restarts don't help — the fault is below them. This script does the
# only software-level fix: tear the stack down to the kernel module, reload
# the driver (which resets the chip firmware), and bring the stack back in
# boot order. Run from the LCD (Settings > Advanced > WiFi Recover) or a
# console; running it over Wi-Fi SSH will drop the session by design.
#
# Must run as root.
