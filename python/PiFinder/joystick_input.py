"""Bluetooth/USB joystick and gamepad input.

libinput (keyboard_pi.py) deliberately ignores joystick-class devices, so a
paired controller connects fine but none of its buttons reach the UI. This
module reads those devices directly through evdev and dispatches the buttons
the user has mapped in Settings > Advanced > Joystick.

Two kinds of actions exist, on purpose:

* Keypad actions inject ordinary PiFinder keycodes into the keyboard queue,
  so they behave exactly like pressing the physical keypad on whatever screen
  is active (arrows navigate, GoTo is the keypad's 5 -- it starts a GoTo on
  the Object Details screen, where a target exists).
* Mount actions talk to the mount-control queue directly, so they work the
  same regardless of the active screen: hold-to-move manual slewing with the
  same lease/keepalive scheme the LCD guide screen uses, slew-rate steps,
  and tracking off.

Buttons are identified by a stable string id: ``BTN_<code>`` for key events
and ``HAT0X-``-style ids for the d-pad hat axes many gamepads use instead of
buttons. The mapping lives in config under ``joystick_mapping`` as
``{action: button_id}``.

evdev import is lazy and failure-tolerant: on systems without python3-evdev
the manager reports "no support" and everything else keeps working.
