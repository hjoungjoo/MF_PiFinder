"""Single-worker, latest-frame-wins background execution.

The camera may publish frames faster than an expensive consumer can process
them.  Queueing every frame increases latency indefinitely, so this helper
keeps at most one in-flight item and one pending item.  A newer pending item
replaces the older one and increments ``skipped``.

The worker is deliberately generic.  The solver can benchmark and validate
the scheduling policy independently before plate-solve arbitration is moved
off the synchronous path.
