"""
Star-count controller for solver-driven auto-exposure.

An alternative to the match-count controller
(``auto_exposure.ExposurePIDController``), selected with the Camera Exp
menu's "Star" item (``camera_exp = "auto_star"``). The feedback
signal is the number of centroids cedar-detect extracted from the frame
(``SolveDiagnostics.Centroids``) rather than the number of stars tetra3
matched against the catalog. That distinction is the point:

* 0 detected -> exposure/optics problem -> zero-match recovery ladder
* N>0 detected but 0 matched -> solver-side problem -> the ladder does
  NOT run (the match-count controller cannot tell these apart)

The control law and defaults follow cedar-server's field-proven exposure
servo (https://github.com/smroid/cedar-server -- calibrator.rs /
detect_engine.rs): detectable star count is modelled as roughly
proportional to exposure, so a single division step converges within a
few solves. Instead of cedar's one-shot calibration, the "anchor"
exposure is learned while running: any exposure that lands inside the
deadband becomes the anchor, which bounds excursions (+/- 3 stops) and
serves as the fallback when the frame is unusable (slewing, clouds,
bright sky).
